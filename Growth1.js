            Babies grow at different rates. On average, at 1 month they gain between 0.7 to 0.9kg each month and grow 2.5 to 4cm. Their head circumference will increase by about 1.25cm each month.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            Babies lose weight right after they are born. Healthy babies usually get back to their birth weight in the first 2 weeks and will then continue to grow. A baby loses up to 10% of their birth weight in the first week and regains this by 2 weeks.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            Your baby was weighed at birth and your doctor or maternal child health nurse will plot their growth regularly on a growth chart. Babies come in all different shapes and sizes, and your baby might be large or small. What matters is that they grow consistently over time.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            Try not compare your baby's weight gain with that of other babies.
